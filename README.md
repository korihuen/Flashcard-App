# Flashcard-App
A flashcard application that uses SM-2 algorithm to determine which card to present to you to help with learning.
The GUI of the app uses Tkinter to perform the basic operations of the flashcard deck. You can create a new deck 
and then open it with the browse feature, this then allows you to review cards if there are any to review the day, or add new ones.
To add a new card, you go the the top bar on mac and select add card, inputting the front and back of the card. After cards are inputted, the user can review them, where they can show themselves the answer to their question then rate on 1 to 5, 5 being the easiest, the difficulty of the cards and the program will determine the appropriate cards to show next time.
